# Project Air quality sensors

* University of Washington Summer 2022 
* Prof. Vikram Iyer.
* Nakseung Choi | graduate research assistant @ ECE UW 

## Description

Aranet4 is a commercialized air-quality(CO2) monitor system that is widely used among many instituations and individuals.
However, the product is quite expensive and its accuracy in measuring CO2 isn't great.
Running a SCD41 on raspberry pi 3, we are currently testing the performance of two sensors and collecting the data on Adafruit IO.

Update (July-07-2022):
ItsBitsy nRF52480 express is going to be employed with Lora Radio (RFM9x) to send/receive CO2 data from a far distance.
